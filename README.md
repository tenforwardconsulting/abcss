# ABCSS

A Sublime Text 3 package that allows instant sorting of SASS into alphabetical order while maintaining nesting and overall file structure.

## Installation

To install this plugin, you have two options:

1. If you have Package Control installed, simply search for ABCSS and install.

2. Clone source code to your Sublime Text 3 packages folder.

## Usage

Press `F5` and your document will be alphabetized within each indent level.

Note: This plugin maintains default sorting, ie. if a file has no indentation, all lines will be alphabetized, or if a selected area is active, those lines will be sorted.
